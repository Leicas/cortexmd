**cortexmd** is a long-term memory and code-navigation brain for AI agents, exposed over the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It indexes your code and notes, stores agent memories with a heat/decay lifecycle, runs hybrid (lexical + semantic) search, and serves cheap code-navigation tools (symbol search, call graph, change-impact) so agents stop burning tokens on whole-file reads.

## Try it in 60 seconds (live dashboard)

The richest way to see cortexmd is the **server (shared-memory) mode**: one HTTP
server that every AI tool connects to, with a live operations dashboard. When you
want a single brain shared across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex, this is the way
— memory written by one tool is instantly recalled by the others.

```sh
./demo/run.sh
```

This builds the server, starts it on `http://localhost:7777`, and seeds it with
realistic data by driving the MCP tools exactly like a real agent would. Then
open **http://localhost:7777/dashboard** (password: `demo`). See
[`demo/README.md`](./demo/README.md) for details, knobs, and how to point your
own AI tools at the running server.

## Two deployment modes (co-equal)

1. **local-stdio** — runs on your machine, talks MCP over stdio, reads your vault(s) directly from disk. No sync, no Docker, no auth, no network. This is the recommended default for individual use.
2. **self-hosted HTTP** *(advanced)* — the existing Express + OAuth2 / Authelia path, for multi-client or remote setups. Source vaults are pulled read-only on an interval (git/WebDAV/S3 via the `IVault` seam).

## The brain-vault model

cortexmd OWNS a separate **brain vault** — the only thing it ever writes to (memories, journal, agent diaries, tasks, knowledge-graph notes, `code-repos.json`). Your private vaults are attached as **read-only source vaults**: indexed for search and code-nav, never modified. Data flows one way, which removes the bidirectional-sync / clobber hazard entirely — the server is the sole writer.

```
  SOURCE_VAULTS[]  (read-only, opt-in, allowlisted)
  ┌───────────┐  ┌───────────┐  ┌───────────┐
  │  notes/   │  │  code/    │  │  docs/    │
  └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘  └─────┬─────┘
        │  index (one-way, read)      │
        └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                       ▼
              ┌──────────────────┐
              │     cortexmd     │   <- sole writer
              │   (MCP server)   │
              └────────┬─────────┘
                       │ writes
                       ▼
              ┌──────────────────┐
              │   BRAIN_VAULT    │   memories · journal · diaries
              │ (own dir, not    │   tasks · KG notes · code-repos.json
              │  your vault)     │
              └──────────────────┘
```

Default `BRAIN_VAULT` is a non-vault data dir (e.g. `~/.local/share/cortexmd/brain`), **never** your Obsidian vault.

## Monorepo layout

```
cortexmd/
├── packages/server/   TypeScript MCP server (Node 22, ESM, Express, search, memory)
├── crates/cli/        Rust indexer + CLI client / hooks / HUD  (one binary: cortexmd-cli)
├── contract/          Shared wire format + symbol-ID spec + golden fixtures (the seam)
├── docs/              Architecture & design docs
└── .github/workflows/ CI: TS build, Rust build/test, contract parity check
```

The project is **polyglot**: two toolchains (TS + Rust) glued by CI, kept honest by `contract/`.

## Quick start (local-stdio)

This is the recommended path for individual use: zero config, no auth, no
network, no Docker, no sync.

```sh
# 1. build the server (Node 22)
cd packages/server && npm ci && npm run build

# 2. run it over stdio, reading one of your vaults read-only.
#    BRAIN_VAULT defaults to a per-user data dir if omitted
#    (~/.local/share/cortexmd/brain, %LOCALAPPDATA%\cortexmd\brain on Windows).
BRAIN_VAULT=~/.local/share/cortexmd/brain \
SOURCE_VAULTS=/path/to/your/vault \
node dist/index.js --stdio
```

Register it with your MCP client (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex) as an **stdio**
server pointing at that command. Tools appear under `mcp__cortexmd__*`.

Then index a repo for code-nav with the Rust CLI:

```sh
cd crates/cli && cargo build --release
./target/release/cortexmd /path/to/some/repo      # index a repo
./target/release/cortexmd scan /path/to/dev-root  # walk + index every git repo
./target/release/cortexmd --help
```

Full walkthrough — install, source-vault `name=path:globs` syntax, optional
features — in [`docs/deploy-local.md`](./docs/deploy-local.md).

### Optional features

All off-by-default-friendly; none required for a working local install.

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `ENABLE_EMBEDDINGS` | `true` | Semantic search. Set `false` for a lexical-only fast path (skips the first-run model download) on low-resource machines. |
| `ENABLE_RERANKER` | `false` | Optional LLM reranker; no default host/model. |
| `DREAM_SCHEDULE` | (empty) | Cron expression for memory "dream" consolidation. |

See [`packages/server/.env.example`](./packages/server/.env.example) for the
authoritative list.

## Advanced: self-hosted HTTP

For multi-client or remote setups: Express over HTTP with API-key or OAuth2
auth, source vaults pulled read-only over a transport (git/WebDAV/S3). This is
the advanced path — most users want local-stdio above.

```sh
cd packages/server && npm ci && npm run build
BRAIN_VAULT=/data/brain SOURCE_VAULTS=/data/sources/notes API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
node dist/index.js   # serves MCP on :3000 with Bearer-token auth
```

See [`docs/deploy-http.md`](./docs/deploy-http.md) for auth (API key / OAuth /
optional forward-auth), reverse-proxy setup, and `SOURCE_VAULTS` over git-pull.
